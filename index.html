    <h1>Voter Characteristics Visualized</h1>
    <h2>&nbsp Who Votes Most Frequently?</h2>
    <iframe src="visualizations/categories.html" width="800" height="500"></iframe>
    <p>In general, it seems like more frequent voters have completed a higher level of education and more income. An
    interesting thing to note is that more sporadic voters are college graduates than people who always vote. It is important
    to note that there are more total sporadic voters than any other category. This is why sporadic voters appear to have the 
    largest portion of most categories in the education and income dimensions.</p>
    <p>Another piece of information that can be gained from this figure is that people
       with a higher education level tend to make more money.

    <h2 margin-top: 2em;>Absentee Ballots and Turnout By Region in Virginia (2014-2022)</h2>
    <iframe src="visualizations/bubble.html" width="1000" height="575"></iframe>
    <p><i>Note: Some observations in the data move out of the range of the figure due to
        percent turnout of over 100%.
    </i></p>
    <p>When viewing the animation through the years, 2020 is the most unique. In 2020, there
        was a much higher percentage of absentee voters than in other years. This is most likely
        the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine guidelines that were implemented during
        that time.
    </p>
    <p>Another interesting observation is that in 2016 and 2020 there is a noticeable increase
        in voter turnout. This is likely because certain people prioritize voting in the Presidential
        elections which occured during those two years.
